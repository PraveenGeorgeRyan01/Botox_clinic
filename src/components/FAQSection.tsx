                  Botox<sup>Â®</sup> is a purified protein authorized by Health
                  Canada and the FDA to treat moderate to severe frown lines,
                  crow's feet, and horizontal forehead wrinkles. At Skin
                  Vitality Medical Clinicâ€”recognized as Canada's #1 Botox
                  Clinicâ€”we provide expertly delivered treatments that help you
                  achieve a smoother, more refreshed appearance. In addition to
                  facial wrinkles, Botox can also treat a range of concerns
                  including masseter Botox for jaw slimming, chin dimpling,
                  bunny lines on the nose, neck bands, and excessive sweating.

                  Typically, Botox<sup>Â®</sup> results last 3 to 4 months, with
                  muscle activity gradually returning around six months
                  post-treatment. Sticking to a consistent scheduleâ€”such as
                  booking your first three sessions every three monthsâ€”can help
                  prolong results. Treatments at Skin Vitality, your trusted
                  Botox clinic near me, are administered by experienced
                  professionals to ensure safe, consistent outcomes.

                  While both are injectable treatments, Botox<sup>Â®</sup> and
                  dermal fillers serve different purposes. Botox<sup>Â®</sup>{" "}
                  relaxes muscle movement to soften fine lines, while dermal
                  fillers restore lost volume in areas like the cheeks, lips,
                  and under eyes. In some cases, Botox can also be used
                  therapeuticallyâ€”for example, masseter Botox may be recommended
                  to ease jaw clenching or help contour the lower face.

                  Discomfort is minimalâ€”most clients describe it as a brief
                  pinch. The treatment is fast and typically doesn't require any
                  numbing. Whether you're smoothing forehead lines or addressing
                  a functional concern, the expert team at Skin Vitality ensures
                  a comfortable and professional experience.

                  Yes. Botox<sup>Â®</sup> softens muscle movement but does not
